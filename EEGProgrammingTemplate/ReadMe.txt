This is a basic template that can be used for programming an EEG experiment in PsychoPy.

In this task, participants are asked to indicate whether numbers (1-9 with the exception of 5) are bigger or smaller than 5. The script has some additional functionalities (e.g., trial-to-trial cues that signal reward trials, a practice phase, feedback after each block, ...).

The idea is that by changing the information in the three Excel files that are stored together with the script (settings.xlsx; ParticipantInstructions.xlsx; stimuli.xlsx), it should be possible to rather easily change this task into another type of task, with minor programming efforts only. For instance, by replacing the numbers in stimuli.xlsx with images, and the correct response information accordingly, one could change this task in a visual classification paradigm rather easily.

Feel free to use this template for whatever purpose you want, and please let me know if you have comments/questions (vincent.hoofs@ugent.be)
